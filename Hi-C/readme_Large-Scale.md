# Hi-C Large-Scale Overview Plotter

This script provides a high-level overview of chromosomal interactions by generating contact heatmaps at a coarse resolution. It is designed to visualize large structural features like Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) across a 10 Mb genomic window.



##  Purpose

The primary goal of this script is a quick, comparative visual inspection of Hi-C data quality and large-scale architecture between **BFMI** and **B6N** strains. By using a **100kb resolution**, the script captures broad interaction patterns rather than fine-scale looping at individual genes.

## 🛠 Features

* **100kb Resolution:** Ideal for identifying domains and compartments over large genomic distances (30 - 40 Mb).
* **Discrete Heatmap Scale:** Instead of a continuous gradient, it uses three intensity levels (White/Gray/Black) to highlight high-confidence interactions while filtering out background noise.
* **Automated Batch Processing:** Loops through all replicates (BFMI1-3, B6N1-3) to produce a consolidated visual report in a single multi-panel plot.
* **Symmetric Matrix Construction:** Properly handles long-format Hi-C data to build full contact matrices for visualization.

##  Requirements

### R Packages
* `strawr`: Required to extract data from compressed `.hic` files.

### Input Data
The script requires access to `.hic` files (Valid Pairs). It is configured to look into subdirectories (e.g., `1BFMI/hic/`) as generated by standard Hi-C pipelines like HiC-Pro.

##  Usage

1.  **Project Directory:** Open the script and set `project_dir` to your root Hi-C data folder.
2.  **Custom Range:** Adjust `range_start` and `range_end` to view different parts of the genome.
3.  **Visual Thresholds:** Modify the `breaks` and `col` parameters in the `image()` function to change the contrast and colors of the heatmap.
4.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    Rscript large_scale_inspection.r
    ```
